TGNet, a neural network combining graph neural networks for local feature extraction with a Transformer module for global context modeling. It efficiently processes B-rep data by unifying geometric sampling, attribute embedding, and hierarchical feature fusion. TGNet is designed as a multi-task network that enables precise recognition and localization of machining features and related surfaces, providing essential support for downstream operations such as part dimension measurement. Experimental results demonstrate that TGNet delivers strong performance on various tasks, showing great potential for real-world industrial applications.
